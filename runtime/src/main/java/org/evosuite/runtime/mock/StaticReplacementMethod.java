/**
 * This @tag is used for methods in the OverrideMocks that
 * cannot be handled with inheritance.
 * A typical example is "final" methods.
 *
 * <p>
 *     These methods will be handled like they were static
 *     replacement ones: ie, same method name, but static, and
 *     with class instance as first input parameter
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: such tag cannot be used in unspecialized EvoSuiteMocks,
 * eg when one wants to mock one single method instead of using
 * a full-blown StaticReplacementMock.
 * Why?
 * First, we want to be sure that we mocked all methods (eg  to check
 * if by error we missed one, or new Java version introduces new
 * ones).
 * Second, a mock class could be used directly in the test as input data,
 * and so its full signature should be available (as the mocked class would
 * not be accessible)
 *
 * <p>
 * WARNING: should only be used on mocking _static_ methods
