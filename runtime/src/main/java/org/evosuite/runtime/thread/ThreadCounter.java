/**
 * In a JUnit test, we do not want to start hundreds/thousands of
 * threads. This could happen if bug in SUT, or if we call it with
 * some specific parameters.
 * So, if a test starts too many threads, just throw an exception.
 * This is particularly useful when running tests in parallel,
 * or in a CI server.
