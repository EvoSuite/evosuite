/**
 * When running tests from a build tool (eg  "mvn test" when using Maven)
 * we need to use this listener (eg, in Maven configured from pom.xml).
 * Reason is to address the following two issues:
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * "manual" tests executed before EvoSuite ones that
 * lead to load system under test classes while the Java Agent is not active.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     Even if no manual test is run, still JUnit could still load some system
 *     under test classes before Java Agent is activated, messing up with
 *     the internal bytecode instrumentation used for environment mocking (eg
 *     file system and networking)
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Note: bytecode re-instrumenting is not really an option,
 * as it has its limitations (eg don't change signature of classes/methods)
