/**
 * Class needed to be on classpath to configure Mockito, which cannot be
 * configured programmatically :(
 *
 * This is essential during search, but should NOT be part of standalone runtime.
 *
 * During search, the same SUT class can be loaded by different classloader (eg, search,
 * assertion generation, junit checks), and would lead to class cast exceptions because
 * Mockito does cache class definitions. So, we have to disable such behavior
