	/**
	 * Inserts one or possibly multiple statements into the given test case {@code test} after the
	 * given position {@code lastPosition}. The test case must not be {@code null} but it can be
	 * empty.
	 * <p>
	 * A test case might contain faulty statements, causing an exception when the test case is
	 * executed. In such situations, the test case's sequence of statements is only valid up to the
	 * first faulty statement. Callers have to specify the position of the last statement known to
	 * be valid by supplying an appropriate index {@code lastPosition}.
	 * <p>
	 * All statements inserted by this method are inserted after {@code lastPosition}. In other
	 * words, {@code lastPosition + 1} is considered the insertion point for new statements. If
	 * {@code lastPosition + 1 < test.size()}, already existing statements located after the
	 * insertion point will be moved towards the end of the sequence as necessary. None of those
	 * statements will be deleted or overwritten.
	 * <p>
	 * If the given test case is empty (as is the case when generating an initial population) the
	 * insertion point is assumed to be at index 0, regardless of the given {@code lastPosition}.
	 * <p>
	 * After a successful insertion, the position of the last known valid statement is updated and
	 * returned. This might not necessarily be {@code lastPosition + 1}, e.g., when multiple
	 * statements were inserted. If insertion was unsuccessful, a negative number is returned.
	 *
	 * @param test the test case in which to insert
	 * @param lastPosition the position of the last valid statement in the test case, defining the
	 *                     insertion point for new statements
	 * @return the updated position of the last valid statement after insertion, or a negative
	 * 		   number if insertion failed
