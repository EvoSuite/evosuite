/**
 * An interface for classes that implement the so called Curiously Recurring Template pattern (also
 * known as F-bounded polymorphism). This pattern is useful to make up for the lack of self types in
 * Java while still maintaining type-safety, albeit at the expense of clean and short class
 * signatures. (The alternative is to resort to unchecked type casts or unbounded wildcards {@code
 * <?>} where a self type would be more appropriate.) Self types are commonly used in abstract super
 * classes or interfaces to refer to the subtype of {@code this}. It is imperative to follow the
 * general contract of {@code self()} as laid out below.
 *
 * @param <S> the self-type

     * <p>
     * Returns the runtime type of the implementor (a.k.a. "self-type"). This method must only be
     * implemented in concrete, non-abstract subclasses by returning a reference to {@code this},
     * and nothing else. Returning a reference to any other runtime type other than {@code this}
     * breaks the contract.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In other words, every concrete subclass {@code Foo} that implements the interface {@code
     * SelfTyped} must implement this method as follows:

     *     @Override
     *     public Foo self() {
     *         return this;
