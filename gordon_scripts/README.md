# Instructions

I created a `generate.sh` script. 
It takes in input 3 parameters:

* starting_seed
* ending_seed
* parallel runs

Therefore, for istance 

> ./generate.sh 1000 1030 10

will generate 30 runs for the chosen criterion with 10 parallel runs.

Once this command is executed, a menu appears end you need to select the version(s)
The menu is the follwing:

```
Choose the version of MOSA/PerformanceMOSA that you want to execute
For more than one version, separate the number with a comma
1 = MOSA
2 = Preference Criterion with SUM combination
3 = Crowding Distance with DOMINANCE combination
4 = Crowding Distance with DOMINANCE combination and EPSILON_DOMINANCE sorting
5 = Crowding Distance with DOMINANCE combination and FAST_DOMINANCE sorting
6 = Crowding Distance with SUM combination
7 = Crowding Distance with MIN_MAX combination
```

The user has to choose 1 or more combination he wants to run.
If you want to run more than once, just use the command to separate the various numbers.

Then, the `run.sh` script will be created to execute the experiment with the chosen configuration. 
Every configuation has a specific python file into the `script` directory (too lazy to use parameters and to have an unique file, sorry ðŸ˜œ)

## Original script
The usage of the underline used python script is the following

```python
Usage:
experiments_performance.py <dir> <minSeed> <maxSeed> <classFile> <maxJobs> <cores>
```

* `dir` is the name of the directory that will be created, storing script, results, logs and so on..
* `minSeed` and `maxSeed` are used to determine the number of iterations to do
* `classfile` is the list of class. This scripts wants a tab formatted text file
* `maxJobs`: set this to 1
* `cores`: number of parallel executions

You have to modify the `experiments_performance.py` file with the right configuration (algo, strategy, combination and so on), and then run the command above.
